/* 

1- Implement a method to calculate the size of a binary tree.  
Solution: Tree.size() 

2- Implement a method to count the number of leaves in a binary tree.  
Solution: Tree.countLeaves() 

3- Implement a method to return the maximum value in a binary search tree using recursion.  
Solution: Tree.max() 

4- Implement a method to check for the existence of a value in a binary tree using recursion. 
Compare this method with the find() method. 
The find() method does the same job using iteration.  
Solution: Tree.contains() 

5- Implement a method to check to see if two values are siblings in a binary tree.  
Solution: Tree.areSibling()  


6- Implement a method to return the ancestors of a value in a List<Integer>.  
Solution: Tree.getAncestors()
